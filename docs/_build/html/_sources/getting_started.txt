Getting Started Guide
---------------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^
This guide is your starting point to learn about LineRateÂ®. We'll walk you through installing LineRate, as well the basics that you need to know to use the command line interface (CLI). The guide then continues with configuring basic examples, including management access, configuring a load balancer (reverse proxy), including SSL setup, and configuring a forward proxy.

About the Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We provide a detailed architecture example, including all naming, IP addresses, and other settings, so you can focus on understanding how to use the software, not on what to name things. 

At the end of the guide, we have a complete annotated example of everything you configured for you to refer to.

After completing this example configuration, you will be better prepared to plan for your LineRate implementation.
